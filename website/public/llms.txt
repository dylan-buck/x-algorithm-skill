# X Algorithm Skill

> Write viral X posts backed by the actual recommendation algorithm source code. No generic social media advice—every recommendation traces to real algorithm behavior.

## Scoring Signals

The Phoenix ranking model predicts 19 engagement probabilities, multiplied by weights and summed into a final score.

### High-Value Positive Signals (maximize these)

**Reply** - Probability user will reply. Ask genuine questions, make claims that invite pushback, share incomplete thoughts others can build on.

**DM Share** - Probability user shares via Direct Message. Share insider knowledge, actionable frameworks, niche-specific content experts share with peers.

**Copy Link Share** - Probability user copies link to share externally. Create reference-worthy guides, lists, frameworks. Evergreen content people bookmark.

**Dwell Time** - How long user spends viewing. Write longer substantive posts, use formatting that encourages reading, open with intrigue.

**Follow Author** - Probability user follows you. Demonstrate unique expertise, promise ongoing value, show personality worth following.

**Quote** - Probability user quote-tweets. Make claims worth commenting on, share takes people want to amplify with their own spin.

### Medium Positive Signals

- Like/Favorite - Basic approval
- Retweet - Pure amplification
- Click - Link/media engagement
- Profile Click - Author interest
- Photo Expand - Image engagement
- Video Quality View - Video completion

### Negative Signals (avoid at all costs)

- Not Interested - Score penalty. Avoid spam, engagement bait, off-topic content.
- Mute Author - Severe penalty. Don't over-post (5-10/day max), stay in your lane.
- Block Author - Severe penalty. Don't be hostile or aggressive.
- Report - Most severe penalty. Follow platform rules.

## Discovery & Retrieval

Two-tower neural network matches post embeddings to user interest embeddings based on engagement history.

### Out-of-Network Penalty

Posts from accounts the user doesn't follow get a penalty multiplier. Your post must score significantly higher to overcome this.

### Author Diversity Penalty

Multiple posts from same author get exponentially discounted. Don't flood the timeline.

### Age Filter

Posts older than threshold are filtered out entirely. Fresh content gets priority.

## Content Structure

### Hook Types (first line is 80% of success)

- Question Hook - Opens with genuine question reader wants answered
- Contrarian Hook - Challenges conventional wisdom immediately
- Insight Hook - Leads with non-obvious observation
- Story Hook - Opens mid-action to pull readers in
- Resource Hook - Promises immediate value

### Body Structure

**Short posts (<280 chars)**: Single punch. Hook + Payoff. No preamble.

**Long posts (280-1000 chars)**: HSP structure. Hook (1 line) + Support (2-4 points) + Punch (closing line).

**Threads**: Each post must stand alone AND continue the story. Label explicitly: "Thread:" or "1/"

### Formatting for Dwell Time

- Every sentence gets its own line
- Short lines create rhythm
- Lists work
- Questions break monotony

## Viral Patterns

### The Insight Thread
Non-obvious observation + "Here's what I learned:" + 3-7 numbered insights + Follow CTA

### The Contrarian Take
Bold claim challenging consensus + brief explanation + optional invitation to disagree

### The Resource Post
Clear value promise + comprehensive scannable content + explicit save/share CTA

### The Curiosity Gap
Create specific curiosity + delay payoff + deliver satisfying answer

### The Personal Story
Start mid-action + quick context + turning point + lesson

### The "So You Don't Have To"
"I [did extensive thing] so you don't have to" + distilled key findings

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Engagement Farmer
"Like + RT + Follow!" triggers Not Interested signals.

### Reply Guy
Self-promotional replies on every viral post trigger Mute.

### Thread Maximalist
Every thought as 20-tweet thread hits author diversity penalty.

### Controversy Farmer
Rage bait gets short-term replies but long-term blocks/mutes.

### Copy-Paste Recycler
Same content reposted hits deduplication filters.

## Pre-Post Checklist

- [ ] Reply: Contains question or debate-worthy claim?
- [ ] Share: Reference-worthy value someone would send to specific person?
- [ ] Dwell: Hook creates curiosity, formatting encourages reading?
- [ ] Follow: Demonstrates unique expertise?
- [ ] Negative: Not asking for engagement, not hostile, on-brand?
- [ ] Hook: Specific, creates curiosity, works standalone?
- [ ] Structure: Proper line breaks, length matches goal?

## Signal Hierarchy

**Tier 1 (Highest)**: DM Share, Copy Link Share, Reply, Follow
**Tier 2 (High)**: Quote, Dwell Time, Video Quality View
**Tier 3 (Medium)**: Retweet, Like, Profile Click
**Tier 4 (Lower)**: Click, Photo Expand
**Tier 5 (Negative)**: Not Interested < Mute < Block < Report

## Key Insight

The algorithm doesn't care about "engagement" generically. It cares about specific actions: replies, shares, dwell time. A post that gets 100 likes but no replies scores worse than a post with 50 likes and 20 replies.

Write for the high-value signals: replies, shares, follows. The rest follows.
