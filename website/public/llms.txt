# X Algorithm Skill

> Write viral X posts backed by the actual recommendation algorithm source code. No generic social media advice—every recommendation traces to real algorithm behavior.

## Scoring Signals

The Phoenix ranking model predicts 19 engagement probabilities, multiplied by weights and summed into a final score.

### High-Value Positive Signals (maximize these)

**Reply** - Probability user will reply. Ask genuine questions, make claims that invite pushback, share incomplete thoughts others can build on.

**DM Share** - Probability user shares via Direct Message. Share insider knowledge, actionable frameworks, niche-specific content experts share with peers.

**Copy Link Share** - Probability user copies link to share externally. Create reference-worthy guides, lists, frameworks. Evergreen content people bookmark.

**Dwell Time** - How long user spends viewing. Write longer substantive posts, use formatting that encourages reading, open with intrigue.

**Follow Author** - Probability user follows you. Demonstrate unique expertise, promise ongoing value, show personality worth following.

**Quote** - Probability user quote-tweets. Make claims worth commenting on, share takes people want to amplify with their own spin.

### Medium Positive Signals

- Like/Favorite - Basic approval
- Retweet - Pure amplification
- Click - Link/media engagement
- Profile Click - Author interest
- Photo Expand - Image engagement
- Video Quality View - Video completion

### Negative Signals (avoid at all costs)

- Not Interested - Score penalty. Avoid spam, engagement bait, off-topic content.
- Mute Author - Severe penalty. Don't over-post (5-10/day max), stay in your lane.
- Block Author - Severe penalty. Don't be hostile or aggressive.
- Report - Most severe penalty. Follow platform rules.

## Discovery & Retrieval

Two-tower neural network matches post embeddings to user interest embeddings based on engagement history.

### Out-of-Network Penalty

Posts from accounts the user doesn't follow get a penalty multiplier. Your post must score significantly higher to overcome this.

### Author Diversity Penalty

Multiple posts from same author get exponentially discounted. Don't flood the timeline.

### Age Filter

Posts older than threshold are filtered out entirely. Fresh content gets priority.

## Content Structure

### Hook Types (first line is 80% of success)

- Question Hook - Opens with genuine question reader wants answered
- Contrarian Hook - Challenges conventional wisdom immediately
- Insight Hook - Leads with non-obvious observation
- Story Hook - Opens mid-action to pull readers in
- Resource Hook - Promises immediate value

### Body Structure

**Short posts (<280 chars)**: Single punch. Hook + Payoff. No preamble.

**Long posts (280-1000 chars)**: HSP structure. Hook (1 line) + Support (2-4 points) + Punch (closing line).

**Threads**: Each post must stand alone AND continue the story. Label explicitly: "Thread:" or "1/"

### Formatting for Dwell Time

- Every sentence gets its own line
- Short lines create rhythm
- Lists work
- Questions break monotony

## Viral Patterns

### The Insight Thread
Non-obvious observation + varied transition (not always "Here's what I learned:") + 2-7 numbered insights (vary the count) + natural closer

### The Contrarian Take
Bold claim challenging consensus + brief explanation + optional invitation to disagree or personal note

### The Resource Post
Clear value promise (skip "ultimate/comprehensive") + practical scannable content + natural closer with personal touch

### The Curiosity Gap
Create specific curiosity + brief delay (don't milk it) + deliver satisfying non-obvious answer

### The Personal Story
Start mid-action + quick context + the turn + optional lesson (don't force one if there isn't one)

### The Effort Summary
What you did (specific) + what you found (varied count, not always 3) + casual closer

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Engagement Farmer
"Like + RT + Follow!" triggers Not Interested signals.

### Reply Guy
Self-promotional replies on every viral post trigger Mute.

### Thread Maximalist
Every thought as 20-tweet thread hits author diversity penalty.

### Controversy Farmer
Rage bait gets short-term replies but long-term blocks/mutes.

### Copy-Paste Recycler
Same content reposted hits deduplication filters.

## Writing Like a Human, Not a Bot

Algorithm optimization means nothing if your posts scream "AI wrote this." The algorithm favors genuine engagement, and users can smell inauthenticity.

### AI Vocabulary Blacklist - NEVER use these words

**Corporate buzzwords**: leverage, utilize, optimize, synergy, stakeholders, robust, comprehensive, streamlined, scalable, cutting-edge, best-in-class, world-class

**AI verbal tics**: Additionally, Furthermore, Moreover, crucial, essential, vital, key (as adjectives), delve, dive into, unpack, landscape, ecosystem, space (for industries), journey, adventure (for experiences), tapestry, myriad, plethora, multifaceted, nuanced, paradigm, paradigm shift, game-changing, groundbreaking, transformative, revolutionary, unlock, unleash, empower, pivotal, pivotal moment, broader implications, overarching, "It's worth noting", "It's important to note", "at the end of the day"

**Sycophantic openers** (never start with): "Great question!", "Absolutely!", "That's a fantastic point!", "I love this!"

**Generic positive closers** (never end with): "Success awaits!", "The possibilities are endless!", "I hope this helps!", "Let me know if you have any questions!"

### Structural Tells to Avoid

**Rule of Three Trap**: AI loves exactly 3 things. Real humans sometimes have 2 things. Or 4. Or 7. Vary your list lengths.

**Negative Parallelism**: "Not just X, but Y" and "It's not about X, it's about Y" are AI favorites. Use sparingly.

**Significance Inflation**: "Pivotal moments." "Broader implications." "Fundamental shifts." Real insights don't need inflation.

**Em Dash Overuse**: Em dashes are fine occasionally. AI uses them constantly. If you have more than one em dash per post, cut some.

**Formulaic Transitions**: "Here's the thing:", "Here's why:", "Here's what I learned:" — these work but are overused. Vary your transitions or skip them entirely.

**The Perfect Structure**: AI posts have suspiciously clean structure. Real posts meander sometimes. That's okay.

### Adding Soul to Your Writing

**Express Genuine Opinions**: AI hedges. Humans commit. Say "Option B is wrong. I've tried it." not "There's something to be said for both approaches..."

**Use Contractions**: "Don't" not "Do not". "It's" not "It is". "Can't" not "Cannot".

**Vary Rhythm Unpredictably**: Short sentence. Then maybe a longer one that goes on for a bit. Then short again. Fragment. Works.

**Include Specific Details**: "Watched three companies blow $2M+ on this exact mistake last year" not "I've seen many companies struggle with this challenge"

**Allow Imperfection**: Real posts have tangents that don't quite connect, incomplete thoughts, opinions stated too strongly, casual asides. AI never includes these.

**Write Like You Talk**: Read your post out loud. Would you say this to a friend at a bar? If not, rewrite it until you would.

### Humanization Checklist

- [ ] Zero words from the AI blacklist?
- [ ] Varied list lengths (not always 3)?
- [ ] No more than one em dash?
- [ ] Using contractions naturally?
- [ ] At least one specific detail?
- [ ] Would you actually say this out loud?
- [ ] Something slightly imperfect or casual?
- [ ] No sycophantic opener or generic closer?

## Pre-Post Checklist (6-Point Audit)

- [ ] Reply: Contains question or debate-worthy claim?
- [ ] Share: Reference-worthy value someone would send to specific person?
- [ ] Dwell: Hook creates curiosity, formatting encourages reading?
- [ ] Follow: Demonstrates unique expertise?
- [ ] Negative: Not asking for engagement, not hostile, on-brand?
- [ ] Humanization: No AI vocabulary, varied structure, sounds like a real person?

## Signal Hierarchy

**Tier 1 (Highest)**: DM Share, Copy Link Share, Reply, Follow
**Tier 2 (High)**: Quote, Dwell Time, Video Quality View
**Tier 3 (Medium)**: Retweet, Like, Profile Click
**Tier 4 (Lower)**: Click, Photo Expand
**Tier 5 (Negative)**: Not Interested < Mute < Block < Report

## Key Insight

The algorithm doesn't care about "engagement" generically. It cares about specific actions: replies, shares, dwell time. A post that gets 100 likes but no replies scores worse than a post with 50 likes and 20 replies.

Write for the high-value signals: replies, shares, follows. The rest follows.

And make it sound human. The best algorithm optimization in the world won't help if your post reads like AI slop.
