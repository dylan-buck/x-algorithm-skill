    description: "Non-obvious observation as hook, followed by numbered insights and a closing CTA for follow.",
    example: `I reviewed 200 failed startups for Y Combinator.

Here's what most people get wrong:

1. They pivoted too late, not too early
2. The cofounder conflicts started before the idea
3. "Running out of money" was the symptom, not the cause
4. The winners had customers before they had product

The real lesson: Speed of learning beats everything else.`,

    bestFor: "Replies, Quote tweets, Profile clicks",
    description: "Bold claim that challenges consensus. Brief explanation without over-explaining.",
    example: `"Work-life balance" is a trap.

The best founders I know don't balance anything. They integrate.

Work is life. Life is work. The separation is the problem.`,

□ Subject line < 6 words
□ First line personalized to them
□ One clear ask
□ Under 100 words total
□ No attachments
□ Send Tuesday-Thursday 9-11am
□ Follow up exactly once at day 3

Save this. Send it to your sales team.`,

    example: `The #1 product at Amazon isn't what you think.

Not AWS. Not Prime. Not Alexa.

It's the internal document culture.

Every major decision starts with a 6-page narrative memo.

That's why they move fast—everyone actually understands the decision.`,

    example: `"We're shutting down the company."

Hardest email I ever sent. 47 employees. Families. Dreams.

But here's what I didn't expect:

Every single person replied thanking me. Not for the job. For being honest.

Transparency isn't just ethical. It's the only way to leave with your reputation intact.`,

    name: "The Direct Value",
    bestFor: "Shares, Replies, Practical engagement",
    description: "Immediate actionable content with no preamble.",

1. Start with the ask
2. Max 5 sentences
3. One action per email

That's it. Stop overthinking.`,

    bestFor: "Share, Follow, Dwell",
    description: "Establish effort, distill key findings, save them time.",
    example: `I read 50 books on negotiation so you don't have to.

Here are the 3 things that actually matter:

1. The person who cares less has more power
2. "No" is the start, not the end
3. Silence is your best friend

Everything else is noise.`,

    description: "Specific prediction with timeframe, brief reasoning, optional stake.",
    example: `Prediction: 50% of SaaS companies will be AI-wrapper businesses by 2026.

Here's why:

- Foundation models are commoditizing
- UX is the only moat
- Infrastructure costs favor thin layers
